## Analysis of Earned Value Model and Integrated Project Model Defect Flow

# ABSTRACT
Software teams spend a lot of effort in reducing errors, and fixing the errors that have been generated as part of the development process. Software models that illustrate and predict the resources needed to reduce development errors, and predict estimation rate to reduce development errors can be of great help to software practitioners. The goal of this project is to help software engineering researchers to analyze the Integrated Project Model Defect Flow Chain proposed by Abdel-Hamid and Madnick, by implementing the model, and optimizing the model using a standard optimizer. In this project we implemented a standard software model that takes software development effort into account and calculates the amount of development errors with certain assumptions, and considering a subset of the full development resource inputs. To optimize the development resources needed to reduce development errors we use the Differential Evoluion Algorithm (DE). We find that DE can minimize on the Integrated Project Model Defect Flow Chain. We observe that a subset of the complete list of development resource inputs is required to provide an optimal solution for reducing errors for this software model of interest. We also observe the necessity of real world software project resource inputs for optimal output.
