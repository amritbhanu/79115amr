seeding is one such factor that may strongly influence this efficiency. seeding we loosely refer to any technique that exploits previous related knowledge to help solve the testing problem at hand.

The objective of such a search is to automatically generate test suites that maximize branch coverage.

In theory the problem should be solvable even without using such knowledge.
Background section says different seeding strategies used in different areas to solve optimization problem.

automated oracles

crossover amounts to exchange of test cases between two parent test suites, while mutation adds, deletes, or changes existing test cases. Changing a test case, in turn, involves deletion, change, and insertion of new method calls.
