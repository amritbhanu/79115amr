Statistical testing generates test inputs by sampling from a probability distribution that is carefully chosen so that the inputs exercise all parts of the software being tested.

Sets of such inputs have been shown to detect more faults than test sets generated using traditional random and structural testing techniques. Search-based statistical testing employs a metaheuristic search algorithm to automate.

information obtained during fitness evaluation is used to direct the mutation operator to those parts of the representation where changes may be most beneficial. significant improvement in algorithm. Performance, and so increases both the cost-effectiveness and scalability of search-based statistical testing. As part of the empirical approach, we demonstrate the use of response surface methodology as an effective and objective method of tuning algorithm parameters, and suggest innovative refinements to this methodology.

directed mutation - When evaluating potential solutions, feedback is normally returned to the search algorithm in the form a fitness metric, and this information is used to guide the algorithm’s selection operator

response surface methodology
'reasonably often' is expressed as an adequacy criterion.
adequate distributions
probability lower bound
software coverage and faultdetecting ability

statistical testing detects more faults than random testing, and that test sets generated using statistical testing that executed each structural element multiple times detected more faults than minimal tests sets generated by traditional structural testing

Since the search algorithm proposed in this paper is an enhancement to that algorithm [6]. the key features as follows:
a) representation: We cannot treat each argument independently since they will interact with each other in the code. Therefore a joint (multivariate) distribution is necessary, and a Bayesian network is used to represent such a distribution. A Bayesian network is a directed acyclic graph.
b) fitness metric - 
3) Search Method: The search method used is stochastic hill climbing

The tuning of parameters is itself an optimisation problem, one approach is to apply evolutionary search algorithms to the parameters, resulting in meta-evolutionary algorithms. We choose to tune the algorithm parameters using response surface methodology.
Our decision to use RSM was based on a belief that would require few subjective decisions and so would contribute to a fair comparison of the algorithms

directed mutation - The overall mutation rate is unchanged; instead the mutation operator is dynamically modified in order to bias mutations towards particular parts of the representation
fitness evaluation
adaptive mutation - the overall mutation rate is modified—over time, based on the recent changes in fitness, or by self-adaption as part of the representation—but the mutation operator itself is unchanged.
